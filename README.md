One way I can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure is by using proper testing techniques such as unit testing.
One way I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program is by closely following the requirements and possibly interpreting them into user stories. 
One way I approach designing software is by first creating sudo code and flow charts, then I code the program while also incorporating tests as I go.
